# FashionMNIST Image Classification

Within the context of the Coding Challenge in the BBWL Machine Learning class of Spring 2020 at the University of St. Gallen, we created
two image classifiers to classify the FashionMNIST dataset. We first built a SVM that uses PCA, which resulted in 90.27% accuracy. 
We further built a Wide Residual Network that manages to classify test images with an accuracy of 95.75%.
